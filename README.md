- 🔭 I’m currently working on R&D about embodied intelligence.

- 👀 I'm also interested in sim2real learning for 3D world problems, including automatic data generation for both synthesis and mixed-reality, domain adaptation, efficient learning network and pipeline, online data generation and training, continual learning etc.
